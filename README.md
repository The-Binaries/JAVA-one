# Java Assessment One - Problem Solving

Welcome to the Java Assessment One repository! This repository contains two Java programs: `Sorting` and `Accounting`, each designed to showcase different aspects of Java programming and problem-solving. Whether you are new to Java or looking to enhance your Java skills, this README will guide you through understanding, compiling, and running each program.

## Program 1: Sorting

### SortingAlgorithms.java

This Java program demonstrates three popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. It generates random arrays of different sizes, sorts them using each algorithm, and measures the execution time for performance analysis.

#### How to Execute

1. **Setting Up Your Environment**:

   - Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

   - Choose a suitable integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or use a text editor for coding. Make sure the Java extension is installed if you are using a text editor like Visual Studio Code.

2. **Creating the Java File**:

   - Create a new Java file in your chosen development environment or text editor.

   - Copy the entire code from `SortingAlgorithms.java` and paste it into the newly created Java file.

   - Save the Java file with the name `SortingAlgorithms.java`.

3. **Compiling and Running**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.

   - Navigate to the directory where `SortingAlgorithms.java` is saved.

   - Compile the Java program using the following command:

     ```bash
     javac SortingAlgorithms.java
     ```

   - Run the compiled program with this command:

     ```bash
     java SortingAlgorithms
     ```

4. **Viewing Results**:

   - The program will execute and display the execution times for Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort for different array sizes.

### SortingAlgorithmsTest.java

This Java program provides test cases for the sorting algorithms implemented in `SortingAlgorithms.java`. It uses a sample unsorted array to validate if each sorting algorithm produces the expected sorted result.

#### How to Execute:

1. **Creating the Java File**:

   - Create a new Java file in your development environment or text editor.

   - Copy the entire code from `SortingAlgorithmsTest.java` and paste it into the newly created Java file.

   - Save the Java file with the name `SortingAlgorithmsTest.java`.

2. **Compiling and Running**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.

   - Navigate to the directory where `SortingAlgorithmsTest.java` and `SortingAlgorithms.java` is saved.

   - Compile the Java program using the following command:

     ```bash
     javac SortingAlgorithms.java
     ```

   - Run the compiled program with this command:

     ```bash
     java SortingAlgorithms
     java SortingAlgorithmsTest.java
     ```

3. **Viewing Results**:

   - The program will run test cases for Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort and display the results in the terminal. You will see if each sorting algorithm passes or fails the test.

## Program 2: Accounting

### Account.java

This Java class defines an `Account` with properties such as customer ID, customer name, customer address, customer phone number, and balance. It includes methods to manipulate the account, such as adding and subtracting from the balance and applying yearly interest.

### AccountDriver.java

The `AccountDriver` program allows you to interact with and manage multiple accounts. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface where you can perform various actions, such as adding accounts, displaying individual accounts, displaying all accounts, depositing to individual accounts, withdrawing from individual accounts, and applying yearly interest to all accounts.

#### How to Execute:

1. **Creating the Java Files**:

   - Create two separate Java files in your development environment or text editor: one for `Account.java` and another for `AccountDriver.java`.

   - Copy the entire code from `Account.java` and paste it into the `Account.java` file.

   - Save the `Account.java` file.

   - Copy the entire code from `AccountDriver.java` and paste it into the `AccountDriver.java` file.

   - Save the `AccountDriver.java` file.

2. **Compiling the `Account` Class**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.

   - Navigate to the directory where `Account.java` is saved.

   - Compile the `Account` class using the following command:

     ```bash
     javac Account.java
     ```

3. **Compiling and Running the `AccountDriver` Program**:

   - Keep your terminal or command prompt open and navigate to the same directory.

   - Run the compiled program with this command:

     ```bash
     java AccountDriver.java
     ```

4. **Interacting with the Program**:

   - The program will display a menu with various options for managing accounts.

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program and manage accounts. You can add accounts, display individual accounts, display all accounts, deposit to individual accounts, withdraw from individual accounts, and apply yearly interest to all accounts.

This README provides detailed step-by-step instructions for compiling and running each program. You can choose to work with either program based on your interests and learning objectives. Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code to enhance your Java programming skills. Enjoy coding!
